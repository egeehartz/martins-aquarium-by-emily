                            <br>
                            Bigger is better when it comes to fish tanks. 
                            A large aquarium not only ensures your fish has ample room to swim, 
                            explore and grow, but it is also easier for you to maintain. 
                            Keeping the temperature and pH balanced is easier with a large tank than with a small one.

                        <div class="tip__specific"><b>Keep the water balanced</b>
                            <br>
                            If the water becomes too alkaline or too acidic it could be fatal to your fish. 
                            Before you go about balancing your fish tank, research the ideal pH level for your fish’s 
                            species as each breed has different environmental requirements.

                            <br>
                            Part of the fun of owning a fish is creating a visually appealing aquarium. 
                            While it’s certainly fun to decorate your fish’s home, it also helps improve your fish’s quality of life. 
                            Fish love to have plants and objects to hide behind and swim through.

                        <div class="tip__specific"><b>Feed your fish a balanced diet</b>
                            <br>
                            Once you determine your fish’s ideal diet, make sure you don’t overfeed him. 
                            Just as with any other animal (or human), overeating can have negative effects on your fish’s health. 
                            Speak to your veterinarian to learn just how much and how often to feed your pet fish.

                            <br>
                            Keeping your fish tank clean is a crucial part of caring for a fish. Nobody likes to live in a dirty home — not even fish! 
                            A dirty tank is ugly to look at and can also be dangerous for your fish. Your cleaning methods will vary depending on the type of fish tank you are using and the items you place inside. 
                            You may be able to use automated cleaning scrubbers or even snails to help maintain your aquarium, but you will still need to change the water and filters on a regular basis. 
                            On top of cleaning the tank itself, you must also clean the tank’s substrate and decorations.
